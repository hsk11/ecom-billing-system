The system comes pre-configured with standard settings, but can be customized through the `config` directory.

## üíª Usage Guide

### Starting the API Server

Launch the server with a simple command:

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### API Documentation

#### Endpoint: GET `/bill`

Query parameters:
- `products`: Comma-separated list of product codes

Example request:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/bill?products=B01,B01,R01,R01,R01
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "products": ["B01", "B01", "R01", "R01", "R01"],
  "MRP": 114.75,
  "discount": -16.47,
  "deliveryCost": 0,
  "finalTotal": 98.27
}
```

### Using the CLI Interface

The system includes a convenient CLI for quick testing and operations:

```bash
npm run start:cli PRODUCT_CODE1 PRODUCT_CODE2 PRODUCT_CODE3
```

Example:
```bash
npm run start:cli B01 B01 R01 R01
```

Example output:
```
Bill Info
{
  products: [ 'B01', 'B01', 'R01', 'R01' ],
  MRP: 81.8,
  discount: -16.47,
  deliveryCost: 2.95,
  finalTotal: 68.27
}
```

## üìä Understanding the Billing Process

The system follows a sequential process to calculate the final bill:

1. **Product Collection** - Gathers all products in the cart
2. **Base Price Calculation** - Sums the MRP of all products
3. **Discount Application** - Applies relevant promotional rules
4. **Delivery Cost Calculation** - Determines shipping fees based on order total
5. **Final Totaling** - Combines all components for the final amount

### Product Codes

The system currently supports the following product codes:
- `R01` - Red Plate
- `G01` - Green Plate
- `B01` - Blue Plate

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Discount Rules

The discount engine can be configured with custom rules in the `services/promotion.js` file. The system supports:

- Buy-one-get-one promotions

### Delivery Charges

Delivery charges are calculated based on order totals and can be configured in `config/deliveryTiers.js`.

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

This will validate all components including:
- API functionality
- Discount calculations
- Delivery cost determinations
- Edge cases

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- **Cart Manager** - Handles product collections and initial calculations
